# Basic Calculator Project
Welcome to my Basic Calculator project! This project is a simple, yet powerful calculator implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It focuses on providing basic arithmetic functionalities in a well-designed user interface. This project showcases my ability to create functional and aesthetic web applications from scratch.

Although currently a very simple project, there is lots of room for adding functionality and features!

## Features
- **Responsive Design:** The calculator is styled to be visually appealing and works well on both desktop and mobile browsers, ensuring accessibility across different devices.
- **Interactive Elements:** Includes interactive buttons for digits and operations, providing a tactile experience as users perform calculations.
- **Elegant UI:** The use of shadows, rounded buttons, and a minimalist color scheme creates a modern and sleek design.
- **Error Handling:** Implements basic error handling for improper mathematical expressions to enhance user experience.

## Planned Features

### Scientific Mode
- **Advanced Operations:** Addition of functions like sine, cosine, logarithm, and exponential.
- **Memory Functions:** Implement memory capabilities such as M+, M-, MR, and MC to enhance usability.

### UI Improvements
- **Theme Switcher:** Implement a toggle to switch between light and dark themes, allowing users to choose their preferred visual mode.
- **Keyboard Support:** Enable keyboard input for using the calculator without a mouse, improving accessibility and speed.

### Additional Features
- **History Feature:** Implement a history panel that records recent calculations, allowing users to review and reuse previous results.
- **Preview:** Implement a mini calculation preview window

These features aim to expand the calculator's functionality, making it a more versatile and user-friendly tool for a broader audience. As the project develops, further suggestions and contributions are welcome to help shape its future direction.


## Technologies Used
- **HTML5:** For structuring the content of the calculator.
- **CSS3:** For styling the calculator interface, demonstrating skills in visual design.
- **JavaScript:** For the core functionality of calculations and interactions within the calculator.
